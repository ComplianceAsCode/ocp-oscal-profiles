# CIS-1.1.6 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `kube-scheduler` service in the master node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required; file permissions are managed by the operator.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, the kube-scheduler is deployed as a static pod and its pod specification file is created on control plane nodes at /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler-pod.yaml. It is mounted via hostpath to the kube-controller-manager pods via /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kube-scheduler-pod.yaml with ownership `root:root`.

Run the following command. 

```
#Verify openshift-kube-scheduler ownership
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-kube-scheduler -l app=openshift-kube-scheduler -o name)
 do
 oc exec -n openshift-kube-scheduler $i -- \
 stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kube-scheduler-pod.yaml
 done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
