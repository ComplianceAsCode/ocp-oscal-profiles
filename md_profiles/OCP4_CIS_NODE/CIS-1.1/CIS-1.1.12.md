# CIS-1.1.12 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the etcd data directory ownership is set to etcd:etcd

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `etcd` data directory ownership is set to `etcd:etcd`.

## Control rationale_statement

`etcd` is a highly-available key-value store used by Kubernetes deployments for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. This data directory should be protected from any unauthorized reads or writes. It should be owned by `etcd:etcd`.

NOTE: The only users that exist on an RHCOS OpenShift node are root and core. This is intentional, as regular management of the underlying RHCOS cluster nodes is designed to be performed via the OpenShift API itself. The core user is a member of the wheel group, which gives it permission to use `sudo` for running privileged commands. Adding additional users at the node level is highly discouraged.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required; file ownership is managed by the operator.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, `etcd` members are deployed on the master nodes as static pods. The `etcd` database is stored on the master nodes in `/var/lib/etcd` and mounted to the `etcd-member` container via the host path mount data-dir with the same filesystem path (`/var/lib/etcd`). The ownership for this directory on the `etcd-member` container and on the container host is `root:root`. 

Starting with OCP 4.4, `etcd` is managed by the `cluster-etcd-operator`. The `etcd` operator will help to automate restoration of master nodes. There is also a new `etcdctl` container in the `etcd` static pod for quick debugging. cluster-admin rights are required to exec into `etcd` containers.

Run the following command.

```
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-etcd -l app=etcd -oname); do oc exec -n openshift-etcd -c etcd $i -- stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/etcd/member; done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control CIS_Controls

TITLE:Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts CONTROL:v8 5.4 DESCRIPTION:Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the userâ€™s primary, non-privileged account.;TITLE:Ensure the Use of Dedicated Administrative Accounts CONTROL:v7 4.3 DESCRIPTION:Ensure that all users with administrative account access use a dedicated or secondary account for elevated activities. This account should only be used for administrative activities and not internet browsing, email, or similar activities.;
