# CIS-1.1.8 - \[Master Node Configuration Files\] Ensure that the etcd pod specification file ownership is set to root:root

## Control Statement

Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.

## Control rationale_statement

The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node. `etcd` is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required; file permissions are managed by the operator.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, starting with OpenShift 4.4, the etcd pod specification file is generated by the cluster etcd operator. The pod specification file is created on control plane nodes at `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-member.yaml` with ownership `root:root`.

The default etcd pod specification file is available here: [openshift/cluster-etcd-operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-etcd-operator/blob/master/bindata/etcd/pod.yaml)

Run the following command :

```
#Verify openshift-etcd ownership
for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-etcd -l app=etcd -o name | grep etcd )
do
 echo "check pod $i"
 oc rsh -n openshift-etcd $i \
 stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-pod.yaml
done
```

Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.

TITLE:Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts CONTROL:v8 5.4 DESCRIPTION:Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the userâ€™s primary, non-privileged account.;TITLE:Ensure the Use of Dedicated Administrative Accounts CONTROL:v7 4.3 DESCRIPTION:Ensure that all users with administrative account access use a dedicated or secondary account for elevated activities. This account should only be used for administrative activities and not internet browsing, email, or similar activities.;
