# CIS-1.2.11 - \[API Server\] Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set

## Control Statement

Do not allow all requests.

## Control rationale_statement

Setting admission control plugin `AlwaysAdmit` allows all requests and does not filter any requests.

The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller was deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off all admission controllers.

## Control impact_statement

Only requests explicitly allowed by the admissions control plugins would be served.

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation is required. The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller cannot be enabled in OpenShift.

## Control audit_procedure

This controller is disabled by default in OpenShift and cannot be enabled. It has also been deprecated by the Kubernetes community as it behaves as if there were no controller. Run the following command:

```
#Verify the set of admission-plugins for OCP 4.6 and higher
oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver get configmap config -o json | jq -r '.data."config.yaml"' | jq '.apiServerArguments."enable-admission-plugins"'

#Check that no overrides are configured
oc get kubeapiservers.operator.openshift.io cluster -o json | jq -r '.spec.unsupportedConfigOverrides'
```

In OCP 4.5 and earlier, the default set of admission plugins are compiled into the `apiserver` and are not visible in the configuration yaml.

For 4.6 and above, verify that the set of admission plugins does not include `AlwaysAdmit`. 

Verify that no unsupported Overrides are configured.
