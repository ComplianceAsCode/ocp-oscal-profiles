# CIS-1.2.15 - \[API Server\] Ensure that the admission control plugin NamespaceLifecycle is set

## Control Statement

Reject creating objects in a namespace that is undergoing termination.

## Control rationale_statement

Setting admission control policy to `NamespaceLifecycle` ensures that objects cannot be created in non-existent namespaces, and that namespaces undergoing termination are not used for creating the new objects. This is recommended to enforce the integrity of the namespace termination process and also for the availability of the newer objects.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

Ensure that the `--disable-admission-plugins` parameter does not include `NamespaceLifecycle`.

## Control audit_procedure

OpenShift enables the `NamespaceLifecycle` plugin by default.

Run the following command:

```
#Verify the list of admission controllers for 4.6 and higher
oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver get configmap config -o json | jq -r '.data."config.yaml"' | jq '.apiServerArguments."enable-admission-plugins"'

#Check that no overrides are configured
oc get kubeapiservers.operator.openshift.io cluster -o json | jq -r '.spec.unsupportedConfigOverrides'
```

In OCP 4.5 and earlier, the default set of admission plugins are compiled into the `apiserver` and are not visible in the configuration yaml. 

For 4.6 and above, verify that the set of admission plugins includes `NamespaceLifecycle` and that the `--disable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that does not include `NamespaceLifecycle`. 

Verify that no unsupported Overrides are configured.
