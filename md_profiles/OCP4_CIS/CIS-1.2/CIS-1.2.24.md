# CIS-1.2.24 - \[API Server\] Ensure that the maximumRetainedFiles argument is set to 10 or as appropriate

## Control Statement

Retain 10 or an appropriate number of old log files.

## Control rationale_statement

Kubernetes automatically rotates the log files. Retaining old log files ensures that you would have sufficient log data available for carrying out any investigation or correlation. For example, if you have set file size of 100 MB and the number of old log files to keep as 10, you would have approximately 1 GB of log data that you could potentially use for your analysis.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

Set the `maximumRetainedFiles` parameter to `10` or as an appropriate number of files.

```
maximumRetainedFiles: 10
```

## Control audit_procedure

OpenShift audit works at the API server level, logging all requests coming to the server. Configure via `maximumRetainedFiles`. 

Run the following command:

```
oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | \
 jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | \
 jq -r .auditConfig.maximumRetainedFiles

oc get configmap config -n openshift-apiserver -ojson | \
 jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | \
 jq -r .auditConfig.maximumRetainedFiles

for OCP 4.6 in place of jq -r .auditConfig.maximumRetainedFiles use:
 jq -r '.apiServerArguments["audit-log-maxbackup"][]?' 
```

Verify that `maximumRetainedFiles` is set to `10` or as appropriate.
