# CIS-3.2.1 - \[Logging\] Ensure that a minimal audit policy is created

## Control Statement

Kubernetes can audit the details of requests made to the API server. The `--audit-policy-file` flag must be set for this logging to be enabled.

## Control rationale_statement

Logging is an important detective control for all systems, to detect potential unauthorised access.

## Control impact_statement

Audit logs will be created on the master nodes, which will consume disk space. Care should be taken to avoid generating too large volumes of log information as this could impact the available of the cluster nodes.

## Control remediation_procedure

No remediation required.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift, auditing of the API Server is on by default. Audit provides a security-relevant chronological set of records documenting the sequence of activities that have affected the system by individual users, administrators, or other components of the system. Audit works at the API server level, logging all requests coming to the server. Each audit log contains two entries:

The request line containing:

A Unique ID allowing to match the response line (see #2)
- The source IP of the request
- The HTTP method being invoked
- The original user invoking the operation
- The impersonated user for the operation (self meaning himself)
- The impersonated group for the operation (lookup meaning userâ€™s group)
- The namespace of the request or <none>
- The URI as requested

The response line containing:
- The unique ID from #1
- The response code

You can view logs for the OpenShift Container Platform API server or the Kubernetes API server for each master node. Follow the steps in documentation. [Viewing the audit log](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.5/nodes/nodes/nodes-nodes-audit-log.html#nodes-nodes-audit-log-basic-viewing_nodes-nodes-audit-log)

#To view kube apiserver log files
oc adm node-logs --role=master --path=kube-apiserver/

#To view openshift apiserver log files
oc adm node-logs --role=master --path=openshift-apiserver/

#To verify kube apiserver audit config
oc get configmap config -n openshift-kube-apiserver -ojson | \
 jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | \
 jq '.auditConfig[]'

#To verify openshift apiserver audit config
oc get configmap config -n openshift-apiserver -ojson | \
 jq -r '.data["config.yaml"]' | \
 jq '.auditConfig[]'
```

Verify that log files are returned. 

Verify the audit log configuration.

# Editable Content

<!-- Make additions and edits below -->
<!-- The above represents the contents of the control as received by the profile, prior to additions. -->
<!-- If the profile makes additions to the control, they will appear below. -->
<!-- The above markdown may not be edited but you may edit the content below, and/or introduce new additions to be made by the profile. -->
<!-- If there is a yaml header at the top, parameter values may be edited. Use --set-parameters to incorporate the changes during assembly. -->
<!-- The content here will then replace what is in the profile for this control, after running profile-assemble. -->
<!-- The current profile has no added parts for this control, but you may add new ones here. -->
<!-- Each addition must have a heading either of the form ## Control my_addition_name -->
<!-- or ## Part a. (where the a. refers to one of the control statement labels.) -->
<!-- "## Control" parts are new parts added after the statement part. -->
<!-- "## Part" parts are new parts added into the top-level statement part with that label. -->
<!-- Subparts may be added with nested hash levels of the form ### My Subpart Name -->
<!-- underneath the parent ## Control or ## Part being added -->
<!-- See https://ibm.github.io/compliance-trestle/tutorials/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring/ssp_profile_catalog_authoring for guidance. -->
