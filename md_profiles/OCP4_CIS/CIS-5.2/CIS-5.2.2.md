# CIS-5.2.2 - \[Pod Security Policies\] Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host process ID namespace

## Control Statement

Do not generally permit containers to be run with the `hostPID` flag set to true.

## Control rationale_statement

A container running in the host's PID namespace can inspect processes running outside the container. If the container also has access to ptrace capabilities this can be used to escalate privileges outside of the container.

There should be at least one Security Context Constraint (SCC) defined which does not permit containers to share the host PID namespace.

If you need to run containers which require hostPID, this should be defined in a separate SCC and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that SCC.

## Control impact_statement

Pods defined with `Allow Host PID: true` will not be permitted unless they are run under a specific SCC.

## Control remediation_procedure

Create a SCC as described in the OpenShift documentation, ensuring that the `Allow Host PID` field is set to false.

## Control audit_procedure

Get the set of SCCs with the following command:

```
oc get scc
```

For each SCC, check whether Allow Host PID is true:

```
for i in `oc get scc --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'`; do echo "$i"; oc describe scc $i | grep "Allow Host PID"; done
```

Verify that there is at least one SCC which does not return true.

TITLE:Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts CONTROL:v8 5.4 DESCRIPTION:Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the userâ€™s primary, non-privileged account.;TITLE:Maintain Secure Images CONTROL:v7 5.2 DESCRIPTION:Maintain secure images or templates for all systems in the enterprise based on the organization's approved configuration standards. Any new system deployment or existing system that becomes compromised should be imaged using one of those images or templates.;
