# CIS-5.2.1 - \[Pod Security Policies\] Minimize the admission of privileged containers

## Control Statement

Do not generally permit containers to be run with the `securityContext.privileged` flag set to `true`.

## Control rationale_statement

Privileged containers have access to all Linux Kernel capabilities and devices. A container running with full privileges can do almost everything that the host can do. This flag exists to allow special use-cases, like manipulating the network stack and accessing devices.

There should be at least one Security Context Constraint (SCC) defined which does not permit privileged containers.

If you need to run privileged containers, this should be defined in a separate SCC and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that SCC.

## Control impact_statement

Pods defined with `spec.containers[].securityContext.privileged: true` will not be permitted.

## Control remediation_procedure

Create a SCC as described in the OpenShift documentation, ensuring that the `Allow Privileged` field is set to `false`.

## Control audit_procedure

The set of SCCs that admission uses to authorize a pod are determined by the user identity and groups that the user belongs to. Additionally, if the pod specifies a service account, the set of allowable SCCs includes any constraints accessible to the service account.

Admission uses the following approach to create the final security context for the pod:

- Retrieve all SCCs available for use.
- Generate field values for security context settings that were not specified on the request.
- Validate the final settings against the available constraints.

If a matching set of constraints is found, then the pod is accepted. If the request cannot be matched to an SCC, the pod is rejected.

A pod must validate every field against the SCC. 

Get the set of SCCs with the following command:

```
oc get scc
```

For each SCC, check whether privileged is enabled:

```
# needs verification
for i in `oc get scc --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'`; do echo "$i"; oc describe scc $i | grep "Allow Privileged"; done
```

Verify that there is at least one SCC which does not have `Allow Privileged` set to `true`.

## Control CIS_Controls

TITLE:Restrict Administrator Privileges to Dedicated Administrator Accounts CONTROL:v8 5.4 DESCRIPTION:Restrict administrator privileges to dedicated administrator accounts on enterprise assets. Conduct general computing activities, such as internet browsing, email, and productivity suite use, from the userâ€™s primary, non-privileged account.;
