# CIS-4.2.4 - \[Kubelet\] Verify that the read only port is not used or is set to 0

## Control Statement

Disable the read-only port.

## Control rationale_statement

The Kubelet process provides a read-only API in addition to the main Kubelet API. Unauthenticated access is provided to this read-only API which could possibly retrieve potentially sensitive information about the cluster.

## Control impact_statement

Removal of the read-only port will require that any service which made use of it will need to be re-configured to use the main Kubelet API.

## Control remediation_procedure

In earlier versions of OpenShift 4, the `read-only-port` argument is not used. 

Follow the instructions in the documentation to create a Kubelet config CRD and set the `--read-only-port` is set to `0`.

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, the kubelet is managed by the Machine Config Operator. The kubelet config file is found at `/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf`. OpenShift disables the read-only port (10255) on all nodes by setting the `read-only-port` kubelet flag to 0 by default in OpenShift 4.6 and above. In OpenShift 4.5 and earlier, the `read-only-port` argument is not used. 

Run the following command:

```

oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver get cm kube-apiserver-pod -o yaml | grep --color read-only-port

oc -n openshift-kube-apiserver get cm config -o yaml | grep --color "read-only-port‚Äù
```

For OpenShift 4.5, verify that nothing is returned. Configuration information is available here: https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes-kubelet/blob/origin-4.5-kubernetes-1.18.3/config/v1beta1/types.go#L135-L141

For OpenShift 4.6, verify that the `read-only-port` is set to `0`.
