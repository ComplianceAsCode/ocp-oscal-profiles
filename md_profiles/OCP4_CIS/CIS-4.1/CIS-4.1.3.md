# CIS-4.1.3 - \[Worker Node Configuration Files\] If proxy kubeconfig file exists ensure permissions are set to 600 or more restrictive

## Control Statement

If `kube-proxy` is running, and if it is using a file-based kubeconfig file, ensure that the proxy kubeconfig file has permissions of `600` or more restrictive.

## Control rationale_statement

The `kube-proxy` kubeconfig file controls various parameters of the `kube-proxy` service in the worker node. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.

It is possible to run `kube-proxy` with the kubeconfig parameters configured as a Kubernetes ConfigMap instead of a file. In this case, there is no proxy kubeconfig file.

## Control impact_statement

None

## Control remediation_procedure

execute command:

chmod 600 /config/kube-proxy-config.yaml

## Control audit_procedure

In OpenShift 4, the `kube-proxy` runs within the `sdn` pods, which copies the `kubeconfig` from a configmap to the container at `/tmp/kubeconfig`, with `644` permissions.

Run the following command:

```

for i in $(oc get pods -n openshift-sdn -l app=sdn -oname)
do
 oc exec -n openshift-sdn $i -- \
 stat -Lc %a /config/kube-proxy-config.yaml
done
```

Verify that the `kube-proxy-config.yaml` file has permissions of `600`.

TITLE:Configure Data Access Control Lists CONTROL:v8 3.3 DESCRIPTION:Configure data access control lists based on a userâ€™s need to know. Apply data access control lists, also known as access permissions, to local and remote file systems, databases, and applications.;TITLE:Protect Information through Access Control Lists CONTROL:v7 14.6 DESCRIPTION:Protect all information stored on systems with file system, network share, claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will enforce the principle that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.;
